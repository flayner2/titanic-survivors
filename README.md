# Introduction

This is my first attempt at implementing any sort of Machine Learning model as part of the Kaggle [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) competition. Data is available at the aforementioned. The results are in the file `titanic_predictions_1.csv`, which scored **0.75119** in the competition. There is not room, but an entire building, for improvement, and this is the first time I try this sort of data analysis, while being more or less informed about how I should approach and visualize my data. I don't really know how to do Machine Learning, I'm learning (lol) it right now. Please be patient.

# Notebook

You can see the entire code and analysis in the [titanic.ipynb](./titanic.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook.
